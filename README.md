# CODE-QUIZ
Homework Assignment #4

Welcome to our javascript coding quiz! This is a great web application to test your abilities and knowledge of the subject!
Upon loading in the page you will press the "Start Button" to begin.

You will be prompted several multiple choice questions but beware you will be timed! Your score will be the total amount of time you have left. But watch out! Any questions answered wrong will remove 5 seconds off of your time, so be sure to read the question correctly and not rush!

Once the questions are finished you will be see the amount of time you had left and be prompted a simple form to store your high score locally to the browser.

If you do not finish the questions before time is up then you lose and will not be able to store your high score!
